Hi Guys, This is the New Technology that Enables the Low Power Consumption, reduction Of complexity and reduce the size in the IoT Stream Development.
 Feature Technologies included
      Nano Gas Sensors
          In India The Smart City Project That  Will Enclose With the Nano Technology.In 2023 The Whole India villages will use the most of Nano Materials.  

INTRODUCTION:
Air pollution is a major environmental health threat
and a risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory disease. Outdoor
air pollution is large and increasing consequence of the inefficient
combustion of fuels for transport, power generation and other human
activities.
According to World Health Organization 92% of the
world’s population lives in the places where the air quality level
increases the WHO limits. Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs),
including black carbon, methane, and ozone, are responsible for a
substantial fraction of climate change as well as for a significant
proportion of air-pollution related deaths and diseases that kill some 7
million people per year.
CASE SCENARIO:
A Cross sectional study was conducted among the
people of Kolkata to investigate about the Vehicular pollution Impact on
them during the period 2007-2010. It was conducted in a place where no
industrial factories were set-up. It was an urban area. The results
obtained from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board states that the
annual average PM10 in ambient air in Kolkata during the study period
was 174.8±98.7μg/m3 in contrast to 56.6 ± 16.4 in control (rural) areas
(p&lt;0.001). The concentration of NO2 and SO2 in Kolkata&#39;s air during
this period was 64.3 ±22.7μg/m3 and 7.2 ± 2.5μg/m3 respectively. This
ultimately shows that the vehicular pollution increases respiratory
symptoms and declines lung function.

According to white paper on pollution prepared by
Ministry of Environment and Forests states that the ambient air quality of
data of Delhi shows very high value of suspended particles which as
beyond the permissible levels from the last several years continuously.
OBJECTIVE:

1. To monitor the increasing level of toxic gases in the
atmosphere continuously.
2. To give an update of the quality of air in a particular
region in particular interval of time and update it
continuously to the end user.
3. To generate a detailed analysis of the quality of air in a
particular region automatically without any need for
manual intervention.
4. To identify the gas which is creating an insidious
situation in the particular area through these results
and eradicating or controlling its root cause.
5. To improvise the concept networking concept from that
of the existing system in order to improvise in faster
data transmission.
