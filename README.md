IMPORTANT NOTE- *****The nodemcu and the nano gas sensor chip design is developing by the CADENCE IC Design tool****** 

INTRODUCTION:

Air pollution is a major environmental health threat
and a risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory disease. Outdoor
air pollution is large and increasing consequence of the inefficient
combustion of fuels for transport, power generation and other human
activities.
According to World Health Organization 92% of the
world’s population lives in the places where the air quality level
increases the WHO limits. Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs),
including black carbon, methane, and ozone, are responsible for a
substantial fraction of climate change as well as for a significant
proportion of air-pollution related deaths and diseases that kill some 7
million people per year.

**CASE SCENARIO:**

A Cross sectional study was conducted among the
people of Kolkata to investigate about the Vehicular pollution Impact on
them during the period 2007-2010. It was conducted in a place where no
industrial factories were set-up. It was an urban area. The results
obtained from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board states that the
annual average PM10 in ambient air in Kolkata during the study period
was 174.8±98.7μg/m3 in contrast to 56.6 ± 16.4 in control (rural) areas
(p&lt;0.001). The concentration of NO2 and SO2 in Kolkata&#39;s air during
this period was 64.3 ±22.7μg/m3 and 7.2 ± 2.5μg/m3 respectively. This
ultimately shows that the vehicular pollution increases respiratory
symptoms and declines lung function.

According to white paper on pollution prepared by
Ministry of Environment and Forests states that the ambient air quality of
data of Delhi shows very high value of suspended particles which as
beyond the permissible levels from the last several years continuously.

**OBJECTIVE:**

1. To monitor the increasing level of toxic gases in the
atmosphere continuously.
2. To give an update of the quality of air in a particular
region in particular interval of time and update it
continuously to the end user.
3. To generate a detailed analysis of the quality of air in a
particular region automatically without any need for
manual intervention.
4. To identify the gas which is creating an insidious
situation in the particular area through these results
and eradicating or controlling its root cause.
5. To improvise the concept networking concept from that
of the existing system in order to improvise in faster
data transmission.

**PROPOSED SYSTEM:**

In the proposed system the disadvantages of
the existing system such as high power
consumption, poor data transmission rate,
usage of online IoT platforms, data accessing
technique, circuit complexity etc.

o In the proposed system, the Microcontroller
used is NODEMCU whose power
consumption is only 3.4-3.6v. It doesn’t need
an extra WIFI attachment to the circuit as it
has WIFI embedded in it. It has on board
antenna and RF balun which is helpful in
long distance data transmission.

o The data from each node is accessed via the
gateway concept wherein the sensor from a
particular region are connected to a single
module and with the help of that module the
data from the corresponding modules could
be easily accessed. This process eliminates
the need for configuring each and every
module to the website. It only needs in
configuring only the gateway module to the
website which reduces the coding
complexity.

o In a single router 16 modules could be
connected, so an area of 6.5km could be
covered in a single router. This technique
would be effectively used to cover an entire
district with a minimum number of routers.

 In this system we are using the Google firebase
console and also 000webhost.com for website
creation which enables the end user to view the
data. This reduces the dependency of online
platforms for data viewing.

 Another method used here is multiple client server
method. This method helps in easy access of data
from any module at any time without disturbing
other module data output.

 In earlier version of air quality monitoring, the
HTTP protocol has been used which lead to
insecurity of the data. In order to secure the data
MQTT protocol has been used in the proposed
system. This protocol has so far been theoretically
explained in the using it in air quality monitoring.
This protocol is an ISO standard publish subscribe
based messaging protocol. It is designed for
connections with remote locations, which would be
useful to collect data in any region.
